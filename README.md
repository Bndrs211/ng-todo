# ng-todo
This project is intended to demo Angular 2+ workflow, with Travis CI for continuous integration and testing.

ToDo items are to be stored on localStorage so that a user can come back and find their items from previous days.

At the end of each day, the list will reset. "Postponed" tasks will be put back into the todo list.

# angular-cli
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.
